Description: # filedb
        Create a file that pretends to be a MongoDB collection. If you try 
        to open the file, it will JSONify the collection and dump it back to you.
        
        ## Why?
        Because our enterprise database is file based, but our cloud based database
        isn't.
        
        ## ...no really why?
        Files are simpler and don't break. The database operations we need to perform
        aren't complicated and don't require high performance. By using files there
        isn't a database that can fail. There's the added benefit that if customers want
        to use different types of databases for distributed systems, we can plug into 
        any of them using a `filedb` (we just have to make something that dumps out JSON
        .
